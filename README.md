Each of the following parts is designed to be implemented independently in sane, incremental steps. 
# Part 1: Water
Immersion or cleaning in water marks purification, such as the *mikveh* in Judaism, or to mark a spritual initiation or dedication, such as the baptism in Christianity, are core parts of many religions.  It is notably absent from Rimworld Ideology, except for the water primacy meme of Alpha Memes.  

## End Goal
A building that provides a means of removing ritual impurity, eg the "observed rotting corpse" thought.

## Design a Building
- Create a 2x2 placeholder graphic.
- Create a building with beauty.
- Create placeholder styles with name overrides.

###  Create a Holy water collection
- Buy only from traders.
- Has an ecumenical collection of holy water.
- Provides enough for your religion throught the priciple of homeotheopathy!

## Remove impurity

### Interaction 
- Create an interaction gizmo to manually remove the impurity
- Has a cooldown to not completely make it abusable.
- Interaction based means we can implement without ideology.

### Ritual
- Use as focus for Conversion Ritual
- New purification mood boost ritual (or allow all pawns to interact with building without touching the cooldown.

### Bad Hygeine Integration

# Part 2: Fasting
